# Interpreter

A basic Swift implementation ["Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter"](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) series.

This is only intended as a project to learn the basics of interpreters, and does not implement the full feature set of the series.

Currently this implements all the features up to [Part 9](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part9/). The only difference is the assignment operator is `=` instead of `:=`.
